**Spicy Kokum Fizz | Kokum Mocktail | Garcinia indica Mocktail** is a perfect refreshment for a hot summer day. 

 Kokum is widely used for cooking in curries in India mostly in Maharashtra, Goa, and some parts of Karnataka. It has many significant health benefits. It resolves health issues like acidity and indigestion. During summers Kokum drinks are very popular.

I visited a newly opened restaurant in Indiranagar, Bangalore with my husband. While going through the menu we saw Kokum mocktail and decided to give it a try. After having a sip we were in love with the drink and tried to guess the ingredients. After leaving Bangalore, we were drooling over that drink so decided to give it a try at home. 
To our surprise, we were able to replicate the taste.
