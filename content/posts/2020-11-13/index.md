<b>Balushahi | Badusha | Makkhan Vada</b> is a crunchy sweetened Indian doughnut-like dessert prepared during festivals like Diwali. It has a flaky texture that just crumbles and melts in your mouth.
</p>
<p>
With Diwali around the corner and preparations in full swing, I thought of sharing a simple yet delicious sweet recipe, which you can prepare at home. This time I was behind the camera and my mother-in-law became the head cook and taught me the Balushahi recipe. It turned out to be perfect and delicious.
</p>

<p>Let's check out the recipe which I learned.

<p> <b>Preparing dough:</b>
 <ol>
  <li>Combine 1 1/2 bowl of maida, a pinch of salt, and baking soda in a wide container.</li>
  <li>Add 1/4th bowl of ghee.</li>
  <li>Mix well. To check for the correct quantity of ghee, try to make a ball roughly. 
  If you can mold, it means the ghee quantity is perfect. Checkout the <a href="https://youtu.be/T8bSNk2HfCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefer">video</a> to see it in action.</li>
  <li>Add 2 tbsp of curd to the mixture.</li>
  <li>Add little water and make a dough.</li>
  <li>Cover it for 20-30 minutes.</li>
 </ol>
</p>

<p> <b>Preparing sugar syrup</b>
 <ol>
  <li>Heat 1 bowl of water.</li>
  <li>Add 1 bowl of sugar and 1 tsp cardamom powder.</li>
  <li>Stir well.</li>
  <li>Bring the mixture to boil on high flame for 10 minutes. Keep stirring.</li>
  <li>The syrup becomes sticky. Check for 1 string consistency by taking a small quantity between your fingers.
  Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/T8bSNk2HfCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefer">video</a> to see 1 string consistency test.</li>
  </li>
  <li>After getting the right consistency, switch off the gas and keep it aside.</li>
 </ol>
</p>

<p> <b>Preparing balushahis</b>
 <ol>
  <li>Remove the cover from the dough. Pinch small/medium sized ball.</li>
  <li>Roll the ball gently and lightly between your palms.</li>
  <li>Make a small dent in the center and keep it aside.</li>
  <li>Repeat the procedure for the rest of the dough.</li>
  <li>Heat oil in a pan on low flame.</li>
  <li>Drop 3-4 balushahis in a pan. Fry them on a low flame till they turn golden brown on both sides.
  Each batch takes 10-12 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>Remove the balushahis from oil and place over the tissue paper.</li>
  <li>Drop them in sugar syrup and soak for about an hour.</li>
  <li>Remove them from the syrup and place on a plate.</li>
  <li>Garnish with dry fruits and enjoy the delicious balushahis.
 </ol>
</p>


<p><b>Tips:</b>
<ul> 
<li>Do not knead the dough otherwise, the flakey texture of the balushahis would be lost.
</li>
<li>Fry the balushahis on medium flame so that they are cooked properly from inside.</li>
<li>To remove impurities from sugar, add 1 tsp milk. After some time the impurities will float on the top and should be removed.</li>
