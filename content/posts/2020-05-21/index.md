 **Fruit custard** is a light, refreshing and delicious creamy dessert.
 It can be a great treat to your guests, family and friends during summer.

Custard was traditionally prepared at home using cream, milk and eggs. Now, we get ready-made custard powder in various flavours. I have used chocolate custard powder bought from market.

Learn how to make fruit custard by following the recipe below.

### Ingredients:###

1. 2 cups (500ml) + 1/4 cup Milk
2. 1/4 cup Sugar
3. 2 tablespoons custard powder ( I used chocolate custard)
4. Chopped seasonal fruits of your choice like apple, banana, pomegranate, grapes, strawberry, papaya and kiwi. Avoid citric and watery fruits.
5. Sliced dry fruits

**Servings: 2**

**Cooking Time:** 20 minutes

### Method:###

1. Heat 2 cups of milk in a broad container over medium flame. Keep stirring occasionally.
2. Add 1/4 cup of sugar when the milk comes to boil.
3. In the meanwhile, take 1/4th cup of warm milk in a bowl and add 2 tablespoons of custard powder. If you are using vanilla custard, add 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder to get the chocolate flavor.
4. Turn off the flame to avoid forming lumps and then pour the custard powder into the milk.
5. Now, cook the mixture on low flame (approx 5-7 minutes) until it starts to thicken. Keep stirring continuously to prevent sticking.
6. Turn off the flame and let it cool.
7. Refrigerate it for about an hour.
8. Add chopped fruits of your choices and the fruit custard is ready.

Garnish the fruit custard with slices of dry fruits, jelly and some chocolate syrup and serve it chilled.
