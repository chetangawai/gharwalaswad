 <b>Fruit custard</b> is a light, refreshing and delicious creamy dessert.
 It can be a great treat to your guests, family and friends during summer.
</p>
<p>
Custard was traditionally prepared at home using cream, milk and eggs. Now, we get ready-made custard powder in various flavours. I have used chocolate custard powder bought from market. 

<p>Learn how to make fruit custard by following the recipe below.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ol>
<li>2 cups (500ml) + 1/4 cup Milk </li>
<li>1/4 cup Sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons custard powder ( I used chocolate custard)</li>
<li>Chopped seasonal fruits of your choice like apple, banana, pomegranate, grapes, strawberry, papaya and kiwi. Avoid citric and watery fruits.</li>
<li>Sliced dry fruits</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Servings: 2</b><br>
<b>Cooking Time: </b>20 minutes<br>
</p>

<h3>Method:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heat 2 cups of milk in a broad container over medium flame. Keep stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>Add 1/4 cup of sugar when the milk comes to boil.</li>
<li>In the meanwhile, take 1/4th cup of warm milk in a bowl and add 2 tablespoons of custard powder. If you are using vanilla custard, add 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder to get the chocolate flavor.</li>
<li>Turn off the flame to avoid forming lumps and then pour the custard powder into the milk.  </li>
<li>Now, cook the mixture on low flame (approx 5-7 minutes) until it starts to thicken. Keep stirring continuously to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Turn off the flame and let it cool.</li>
<li>Refrigerate it for about an hour.</li>
<li>Add chopped fruits of your choices and the fruit custard is ready.</li>
</ol>

<p>Garnish the fruit custard with slices of dry fruits, jelly and some chocolate syrup and serve it chilled.</p>
