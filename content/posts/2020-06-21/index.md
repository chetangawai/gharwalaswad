  <b>Prepare batter</b>
  <ol>
   <li>Take 1 cup of besan (gram flour) and curd in a bowl. </li>
<li>Add 1 tsp ginger-chilli paste, 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp hing. </li>
<li>Pour 2 cups of water. </li>
<li>Mix it well with the help of whisk to remove any lumps and get a smooth batter. </li>
<li>Strain the batter with a strainer to remove leftover lumps. </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Tempering</b>
<ol>
<li>Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a pan. </li>
<li>Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, a pinch of hing, few curry leaves and let them splutter. </li>
<li>Toss some sesame seeds (til) and freshly grated coconut. </li>
<li>Switch off the gas in 30-40 seconds. Do not cook the coconut for long. We want to enjoy the fresh flavour of coconut. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Khandvi preparation</b>
  <ol>
  <li>In a wide pan pour the batter. </li>
  <li>Cook it on medium flame. </li>
<li>Stir it continuously till the batter begins to thicken and you reach paste-like consistency. 
    It will take approximately 10-12 minutes to cook. Getting this right is the tricky part of Khandvi.
  <br> <b>Note:</b>  To check for the right consistency, spread a small amount of batter on an inverted plate. Let it cool for a minute and then try to peel and roll. If this can be achieved properly then your batter is ready for rolls otherwise let it cook for some more time.

</li>
<li>Meanwhile, grease 2-3 big sized inverted plates with oil so as to ease rolling. </li>
<li>Quickly spread a thin layer of batter evenly on each plate before the batter cools down. Once the batter is cooled it will be difficult to make rolls. </li>
<li>Sparingly pour the seasoned tempering on each plate. </li>
<li>Sprinkle few finely chopped coriander leaves. </li>
<li>Let the batter cool for 1-2 minutes. </li>
<li>Cut into strips two inches wide. </li>
<li>Roll each strip tightly and carefully. </li>
<li>Arrange the khandvis in a plate and garnish them with leftover tempering and finely chopped fresh coriander leaves. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Serve the Khandvis hot with any chutney or ginger tea. </p>
