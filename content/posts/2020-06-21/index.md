**Prepare batter**

1. Take 1 cup of besan (gram flour) and curd in a bowl.
2. Add 1 tsp ginger-chilli paste, 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp hing.
3. Pour 2 cups of water.
4. Mix it well with the help of whisk to remove any lumps and get a smooth batter.
5. Strain the batter with a strainer to remove leftover lumps.

**Tempering**

1. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a pan.
2. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, a pinch of hing, few curry leaves and let them splutter.
3. Toss some sesame seeds (til) and freshly grated coconut.
4. Switch off the gas in 30-40 seconds. Do not cook the coconut for long. We want to enjoy the fresh flavour of coconut.

**Khandvi preparation**

1. In a wide pan pour the batter.
2. Cook it on medium flame.
3. Stir it continuously till the batter begins to thicken and you reach paste-like consistency.
    It will take approximately 10-12 minutes to cook. Getting this right is the tricky part of Khandvi.
  **Note:**   To check for the right consistency, spread a small amount of batter on an inverted plate. Let it cool for a minute and then try to peel and roll. If this can be achieved properly then your batter is ready for rolls otherwise let it cook for some more time.

4. Meanwhile, grease 2-3 big sized inverted plates with oil so as to ease rolling.
5. Quickly spread a thin layer of batter evenly on each plate before the batter cools down. Once the batter is cooled it will be difficult to make rolls.
6. Sparingly pour the seasoned tempering on each plate.
7. Sprinkle few finely chopped coriander leaves.
8. Let the batter cool for 1-2 minutes.
9. Cut into strips two inches wide.
10. Roll each strip tightly and carefully.
11. Arrange the khandvis in a plate and garnish them with leftover tempering and finely chopped fresh coriander leaves.

Serve the Khandvis hot with any chutney or ginger tea.
