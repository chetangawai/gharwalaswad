  2. Add finely chopped carrot, capsicum and coriander.
  3. For the spicy flavour, add 1/4 th tsp black pepper, some chilli flakes, oregano and salt.
  4. Mix everything well.
  5. Keep the bowl aside.
  6. In a small bowl, we will prepare slurry. Add 2 tbsp maida and some water. Stir it well. The mixture should have medium consistency.
  Do not add too much water.
  7. Take a bread slice and cut the edges.
  8. Roll gently on one side.
  9. Apply some water over it.
  10. Again, roll gently and flip the slice.
  11. Pour 1 tbsp stuffing on the slice.
  12. Apply the maida slurry on the edges so that the roll sticks properly.
  13. Gently roll the slice putting the stuffing inside.
  14. Place the roll in a plate.
  15. Similarly, roll other slices.
  16. Heat oil in a pan on medium flame.
  17. Drop each roll one by one into the pan. Fry the rolls till they turn golden brown. Each roll would take 3-4 minutes for frying.

**Yipee!** Crispy and lip smacking kebabs are ready to be served. Enjoy them hot with tomato ketchup or any chutney.

**Tips:**

1. Hang curd in a clean cotton cloth over night to drain out all the water.
2. For frying, oil should be medium hot to get crispy and perfect kebabs. If oil is too hot, kebabs will not be crispy. If  oil is less hot kebabs will break.
