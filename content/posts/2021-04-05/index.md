**Pudina Juice | Mint Juice | Lemon-Mint Drink| Mint Lemonade** is a perfect summer coolant to detoxify our body. It balances water content of the body and keeps us hydrated boosting our energy and mood for the day.

I have lot of mint growing in my balcony garden. I use mint in number of my recipes but the Mint juice is my favorite.

Most of the guests and friends who have visited my home are always served with this refreshing drink. It has become famous amongst my circle. My husband learned this recipe and now he is the one who is in charge of preparing the drink ðŸ˜ƒ.

1. Rinse a large bowl of fresh pudina/mint leaves thoroughly and add them to a mixer jar .

2. Pour 2 glasses of water.

3. Add 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp black salt, 3/4 th tsp normal salt, 4-5 tbsp sugar.
   
    Adjust the sweetness as per your taste.
    Jaggery could be added if you want to avoid sugar but it will darken the color of juice.
    Lemon juice gives a nice tangy taste and helps to preserve the color of mint leaves.

4. Add 1 tsp of roasted jeera/cumin powder to enhance the taste. This step is optional.

5. Blend the mixture for 2 minutes.

6. Strain the juice if you want.

7. Add some ice cubes and serve it chilled.

8. To give it some spicy touch add a mixture of red chilly powder and salt to the brim of glasses.
