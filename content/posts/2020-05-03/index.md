**Solkadhi** - A popular digestive and detoxifying coolant for your body. It is mostly relished after non-veg or spicy food to cool down the digestive system. The drink gets its pinkish color through kokam (dried garcinia indica). Kokum is an excellent antidote for acidity. Kokum drinks are highly preferred in summers.

I am sharing the recipe which I learned from my mother in law.

### Ingredients:###

1. 8-10 kokum petals
2. 1 cup water
3. 2 green chillies
4. 1-2 garlic cloves
5. 3-4 saffron strands
6. 1 pinch of black/rock salt
7. 1 tablespoon roasted cumin powder
8. Salt
9. Finely cut few coriander leaves for garnishing

**Servings:** 4

**Cooking Time:** 20 minutes

**Cuisine:** Goan, Kokani, Maharashtrian (Indian)

### Method:###

1. Boil 8-10 petals of kokum in 1 cup of water for 5-10 mins. Stir well.
2. Let it cool down.
3. Squeeze the kokum. It will give you pinkish extract.
4. Blend freshly shredded coconut with 1 green chili, 1-2 garlic cloves and some water.
5. Squeeze out all the coconut juice.
6. If you feel the pulp still contains milk, add it to the blender with half cup of water and blend it.
7. Strain kokum extract into coconut milk. Coconut milk helps to reduce the sour taste of kokum to some extend.
8. Add black salt, roasted cumin powder, salt and garnish it with coriander leaves.

Serve it chilled with your meal especially non-veg meals.
