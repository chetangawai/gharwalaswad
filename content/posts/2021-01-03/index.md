  2. In a bowl, mix all the ingredients. The mixture should not be too thin. It should have the right consistency to apply on the leaves.
  3. Keep it aside for 5 mins.
  4. Place one leaf on a flat surface.
  5. Apply the mixture to the leaf.
  6. Place another leaf over it in an inverted manner and apply the mixture on it.
  7. Repeat the last 2 steps for 2-3 leaves.  
  8. Make a set of 4-5 leaves for one roll. Check out the [video](https://youtu.be/PBdLWlDZpYo)
  for the procedure.
  9. Fold the vertical edges and apply the mixture.
  10. Roll the set from one end to the other end.
  11. Apply the mixture on both ends.
  12. Similarly prepare other rolls if you have more leaves.  
  13. Place the rolls in a steamer and steam for 10-15 minutes.
  14. Check if the rolls are steamed properly by pricking a fork or a toothpick. If the fork/toothpick comes out to be clean the rolls are perfectly steamed.
  15. Remove the rolls from the steamer and let them cool for 10 mins.
  16. Cut each roll into 1/2 inch thickness.
  17. Shallow or deep fry the vadis as per your choice. You can enjoy the steamed vadis as well for the more healthier option.
  18. Garnish the vadis with fresh coriander leaves or grated coconut and serve with chutney of your choice.

**Note:**
To store the rolls for 1-2 days, refrigerate the steamed rolls after bringing them to room temperature.
