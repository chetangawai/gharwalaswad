 <ol>
  <li>Cut the central thick veins of the leaves and flatten with a rolling pin.

  </li>
  <li>In a bowl, mix all the ingredients. The mixture should not be too thin. It should have the right consistency to apply on the leaves.</li>
  <li>Keep it aside for 5 mins.</li>
  <li>Place one leaf on a flat surface.</li>
  <li>Apply the mixture to the leaf.</li>
  <li>Place another leaf over it in an inverted manner and apply the mixture on it.</li>
  <li>Repeat the last 2 steps for 2-3 leaves. </li>
  <li>Make a set of 4-5 leaves for one roll. Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/PBdLWlDZpYo" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefer">video</a> for the procedure.</li>
  <li>Fold the vertical edges and apply the mixture.</li>
  <li>Roll the set from one end to the other end.</li>
  <li>Apply the mixture on both ends.</li>
  <li>Similarly prepare other rolls if you have more leaves. </li>
  <li>Place the rolls in a steamer and steam for 10-15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check if the rolls are steamed properly by pricking a fork or a toothpick. If the fork/toothpick comes out to be clean the rolls are perfectly steamed.</li>
  <li>Remove the rolls from the steamer and let them cool for 10 mins.</li>
  <li>Cut each roll into 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
  <li>Shallow or deep fry the vadis as per your choice. You can enjoy the steamed vadis as well for the more healthier option.</li>
  <li>Garnish the vadis with fresh coriander leaves or grated coconut and serve with chutney of your choice.</li>
